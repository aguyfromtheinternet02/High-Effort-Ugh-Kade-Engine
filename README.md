> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music... 

## Kade Engine
**Kade Engine** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin', including a full engine rework, replays, and more.

Links: **[GameBanana mod page](https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/16761) ⋅ [play in browser](https://funkin.puyo.xyz) ⋅ [latest stable release](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine/releases/latest) ⋅ [latest development build (windows)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KadeDev/kade-engine-windows/branch/master/artifacts) ⋅ [latest development build (macOS)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KadeDev/kade-engine-macos/branch/master/artifacts) ⋅ [latest development build (linux)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KadeDev/kade-engine-linux/branch/master/artifacts)**

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can customize the keybinds to any keys you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
